  Configure Karpenter with NodePools
---

When you first installed Karpenter, you set up a default NodePool. The NodePool sets constraints on the nodes that can be created by Karpenter and the pods that can run on those nodes. The NodePool can be set to do things like:

* Define taints to limit the pods that can run on nodes Karpenter creates
* Define any startup taints to inform Karpenter that it should taint the node initially, but that the taint is temporary.
* Limit node creation to certain zones, instance types, and computer architectures
* Set defaults for node expiration

You can change your NodePool or add other NodePools to Karpenter.
Here are things you should know about NodePools:

* Karpenter won't do anything if there is not at least one NodePool configured.
* Each NodePool that is configured is looped through by Karpenter.
* If Karpenter encounters a taint in the NodePool that is not tolerated by a Pod, Karpenter won't use that NodePool to provision the pod.
* If Karpenter encounters a startup taint in the NodePool it will be applied to nodes that are provisioned, but pods do not need to tolerate the taint.  Karpenter assumes that the taint is temporary and some other system will remove the taint.
* It is recommended to create NodePools that are mutually exclusive. So no Pod should match multiple NodePools. If multiple NodePools are matched, Karpenter will use the NodePool with the highest [weight](#specweight).

Objects for setting Kubelet features have been moved from the NodePool spec to the EC2NodeClasses spec, to not require other Karpenter providers to support those features.

## metadata.name
The name of the NodePool.

## spec.template.metadata.labels
Arbitrary key/value pairs to apply to all nodes.

## spec.template.metadata.annotations
Arbitrary key/value pairs to apply to all nodes.

## spec.template.spec.nodeClassRef

This field points to the Cloud Provider NodeClass resource. See [EC2NodeClasses]({{<ref "nodeclasses" >}}) for details.

## spec.template.spec.taints

Taints to add to provisioned nodes. Pods that don't tolerate those taints could be prevented from scheduling.
See [Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) for details.

## spec.template.spec.startupTaints

Taints that are added to nodes to indicate that a certain condition must be met, such as starting an agent or setting up networking, before the node is can be initialized. 
These taints must be cleared before pods can be deployed to a node.

## spec.template.spec.expireAfter

The amount of time a Node can live on the cluster before being deleted by Karpenter. Nodes will begin draining once it's expiration has been hit. 

## spec.template.spec.terminationGracePeriod

The amount of time a Node can be draining before Karpenter forcibly cleans up the node. Pods blocking eviction like PDBs and do-not-disrupt will be respected during draining until the `terminationGracePeriod` is reached, where those pods will be forcibly deleted.

## spec.template.spec.requirements

Kubernetes defines the following [Well-Known Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/), and cloud providers (e.g., AWS) implement them. They are defined at the "spec.requirements" section of the NodePool API.

In addition to the well-known labels from Kubernetes, Karpenter supports AWS-specific labels for more advanced scheduling. See the full list [here](../scheduling/#well-known-labels).

These well-known labels may be specified at the NodePool level, or in a workload definition (e.g., nodeSelector on a pod.spec). Nodes are chosen using both the NodePool's and pod's requirements. If there is no overlap, nodes will not be launched. In other words, a pod's requirements must be within the NodePool's requirements. If a requirement is not defined for a well known label, any value available to the cloud provider may be chosen.

For example, an instance type may be specified using a nodeSelector in a pod spec. If the instance type requested is not included in the NodePool list and the NodePool has instance type requirements, Karpenter will not create a node or schedule the pod.

### Well-Known Labels

#### Instance Types

- key: `node.kubernetes.io/instance-type`
- key: `karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-family`
- key: `karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-category`
- key: `karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-generation`

Generally, instance types should be a list and not a single value. Leaving these requirements undefined is recommended, as it maximizes choices for efficiently placing pods.

Review [AWS instance types](../instance-types). Most instance types are supported with the exclusion of [non-HVM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html).

#### Availability Zones

- key: `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`
- value example: `us-east-1c`
- value list: `aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region <region-name>`

Karpenter can be configured to create nodes in a particular zone. Note that the Availability Zone `us-east-1a` for your AWS account might not have the same location as `us-east-1a` for another AWS account.

[Learn more about Availability Zone
IDs.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-az-ids.html)

#### Architecture

- key: `kubernetes.io/arch`
- values
  - `amd64`
  - `arm64`

Karpenter supports `amd64` nodes, and `arm64` nodes.

#### Operating System
 - key: `kubernetes.io/os`
 - values
   - `linux`
   - `windows`

Karpenter supports `linux` and `windows` operating systems.

#### Capacity Type

- key: `karpenter.sh/capacity-type`
- values
  - `spot`
  - `on-demand`

Karpenter supports specifying capacity type, which is analogous to [EC2 purchase options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-purchasing-options.html).

Karpenter prioritizes Spot offerings if the NodePool allows Spot and on-demand instances. If the provider API (e.g. EC2 Fleet's API) indicates Spot capacity is unavailable, Karpenter caches that result across all attempts to provision EC2 capacity for that instance type and zone for the next 45 seconds. If there are no other possible offerings available for Spot, Karpenter will attempt to provision on-demand instances, generally within milliseconds.

Karpenter also allows `karpenter.sh/capacity-type` to be used as a topology key for enforcing topology-spread.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
There is currently a limit of 100 on the total number of requirements on both the NodePool and the NodeClaim. It's important to note that `spec.template.metadata.labels` are also propagated as requirements on the NodeClaim when it's created, meaning that you can't have more than 100 requirements and labels combined set on your NodePool.
{{% /alert %}}

### Min Values

Along with the combination of [key,operator,values] in the requirements, Karpenter also supports `minValues` in the NodePool requirements block, allowing the scheduler to be aware of user-specified flexibility minimums while scheduling pods to a cluster. If Karpenter cannot meet this minimum flexibility for each key when scheduling a pod, it will fail the scheduling loop for that NodePool, either falling back to another NodePool which meets the pod requirements or failing scheduling the pod altogether.

For example, the below spec will use spot instance type for all provisioned instances and enforces `minValues` to various keys where it is defined
i.e at least 2 unique instance families from [c,m,r], 5 unique instance families [eg: "m5","m5d","r4","c5","c5d","c4" etc], 10 unique instance types [eg: "c5.2xlarge","c4.xlarge" etc] is required for scheduling the pods.

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      requirements:
        - key: kubernetes.io/arch
          operator: In
          values: ["amd64"]
        - key: kubernetes.io/os
          operator: In
          values: ["linux"]
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-category
          operator: In
          values: ["c", "m", "r"]
          minValues: 2
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-family
          operator: Exists
          minValues: 5
        - key: node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
          operator: Exists
          minValues: 10
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-generation
          operator: Gt
          values: ["2"]
```

Note that `minValues` can be used with multiple operators and multiple requirements. And if the `minValues` are defined with multiple operators for the same requirement key, scheduler considers the max of all the `minValues` for that requirement. For example, the below spec requires scheduler to consider at least 5 instance-family to schedule the pods.

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      requirements:
        - key: kubernetes.io/arch
          operator: In
          values: ["amd64"]
        - key: kubernetes.io/os
          operator: In
          values: ["linux"]
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-category
          operator: In
          values: ["c", "m", "r"]
          minValues: 2
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-family
          operator: Exists
          minValues: 5
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-family
          operator: In
          values: ["m5","m5d","c5","c5d","c4","r4"]
          minValues: 3
        - key: node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
          operator: Exists
          minValues: 10
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-generation
          operator: Gt
          values: ["2"]
```

{{% alert title="Recommended" color="primary" %}}
Karpenter allows you to be extremely flexible with your NodePools by only constraining your instance types in ways that are absolutely necessary for your cluster. By default, Karpenter will enforce that you specify the `spec.template.spec.requirements` field, but will not enforce that you specify any requirements within the field. If you choose to specify `requirements: []`, this means that you will completely flexible to _all_ instance types that your cloud provider supports.

Though Karpenter doesn't enforce these defaults, for most use-cases, we recommend that you specify _some_ requirements to avoid odd behavior or exotic instance types. Below, is a high-level recommendation for requirements that should fit the majority of use-cases for generic workloads

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      requirements:
        - key: kubernetes.io/arch
          operator: In
          values: ["amd64"]
        - key: kubernetes.io/os
          operator: In
          values: ["linux"]
        - key: karpenter.sh/capacity-type
          operator: In
          values: ["on-demand"]
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-category
          operator: In
          values: ["c", "m", "r"]
        - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-generation
          operator: Gt
          values: ["2"]
```

{{% /alert %}}


## spec.disruption

You can configure Karpenter to disrupt Nodes through your NodePool in multiple ways. You can use `spec.disruption.consolidationPolicy`, `spec.disruption.consolidateAfter`, or `spec.template.spec.expireAfter`.
You can also rate limit Karpenter's disruption through the NodePool's `spec.disruption.budgets`.
Read [Disruption]({{<ref "disruption" >}}) for more.

## spec.limits

The NodePool spec includes a limits section (`spec.limits`), which constrains the maximum amount of resources that the NodePool will manage.

Karpenter supports limits of any resource type reported by your cloudprovider. It limits instance types when scheduling to those that will not exceed the specified limits.  If a limit has been exceeded, nodes provisioning is prevented until some nodes have been terminated.

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      requirements:
        - key: karpenter.sh/capacity-type
          operator: In
          values: ["spot"]
  limits:
    cpu: 1000
    memory: 1000Gi
    nvidia.com/gpu: 2
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Karpenter provisioning is highly parallel. Because of this, limit checking is eventually consistent, which can result in overrun during rapid scale outs.
{{% /alert %}}

CPU limits are described with a `DecimalSI` value. Note that the Kubernetes API will coerce this into a string, so we recommend against using integers to avoid GitOps skew.

Memory limits are described with a [`BinarySI` value, such as 1000Gi.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory)

You can view the current consumption of cpu and memory on your cluster by running:
```
kubectl get nodepool -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].status}'
```

Review the [Kubernetes core API](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/37748cca582229600a3599b40e9a82a951d8bbbf/core/v1/resource.go#L23) (`k8s.io/api/core/v1`) for more information on `resources`.

## spec.weight

Karpenter allows you to describe NodePool preferences through a `weight` mechanism similar to how weight is described with [pod and node affinities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

For more information on weighting NodePools, see the [Weighted NodePools section]({{<ref "scheduling#weighted-nodepools" >}}) in the scheduling docs.

## status.conditions
[Conditions](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/blob/f14778da5523847e4c07346e3161a4b4f6c9186e/pkg/apis/meta/v1/types.go#L1523) objects add observability features to Karpenter.
* The `status.conditions.type` object reflects node status, such as `Initialized` or `Available`.
* The status of the condition, `status.conditions.status`, indicates if the condition is `True` or `False`.
* The `status.conditions.observedGeneration` indicates  if the instance is out of date with the current state of `.metadata.generation`.
* The `status.conditions.lastTransitionTime` object contains a programatic identifier that indicates the time of the condition's previous transition.
* The `status.conditions.reason` object indicates the reason for the condition's previous transition.
* The `status.conditions.message` object provides human-readable details about the condition's previous transition.

## status.resources
Objects under `status.resources` provide information about the status of resources such as `cpu`, `memory`, and `ephemeral-storage`.

## Examples

### Isolating Expensive Hardware

A NodePool can be set up to only provision nodes on particular processor types.
The following example sets a taint that only allows pods with tolerations for Nvidia GPUs to be scheduled:

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: gpu
spec:
  disruption:
    consolidationPolicy: WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized
  template:
    spec:
      requirements:
      - key: node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
        operator: In
        values: ["p3.8xlarge", "p3.16xlarge"]
      taints:
      - key: nvidia.com/gpu
        value: "true"
        effect: NoSchedule
```
In order for a pod to run on a node defined in this NodePool, it must tolerate `nvidia.com/gpu` in its pod spec.

### Cilium Startup Taint

Per the Cilium [docs](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/installation/taints/#taint-effects), it's recommended to place a taint of `node.cilium.io/agent-not-ready=true:NoExecute` on nodes to allow Cilium to configure networking prior to other pods starting.  This can be accomplished via the use of Karpenter `startupTaints`.  These taints are placed on the node, but pods aren't required to tolerate these taints to be considered for provisioning.

Failure to provide accurate `startupTaints` can result in Karpenter continually provisioning new nodes. When the new node joins and the startup taint that Karpenter is unaware of is added, Karpenter now considers the pending pod to be unschedulable to this node. Karpenter will attempt to provision yet another new node to schedule the pending pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: cilium-startup
spec:
  disruption:
    consolidationPolicy: WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized
  template:
    spec:
      startupTaints:
      - key: node.cilium.io/agent-not-ready
        value: "true"
        effect: NoExecute
```
