Karpenter is an open-source autoscaling project built for Kubernetes. It improves availability for Kubernetes applications without requiring manually or over-provisioning compute resources. Karpenter is designed to provide the right compute resources to match your application’s needs in seconds, instead of minutes by observing the aggregate resource requests of unschedulable pods and makes decisions to launch and terminate nodes to minimize scheduling latencies.
