## Unreleased

## 1.23.2 / 2025-09-05

This release is made to upgrade to prometheus/common v0.66.1, which drops the dependencies github.com/grafana/regexp and go.uber.org/atomic and replaces gopkg.in/yaml.v2 with go.yaml.in/yaml/v2 (a drop-in replacement).
There are no functional changes.

## 1.23.1 / 2025-09-04

This release is made to be compatible with a backwards incompatible API change
in prometheus/common v0.66.0. There are no functional changes.

## 1.23.0 / 2025-07-30

* [CHANGE] Minimum required Go version is now 1.23, only the two latest Go versions are supported from now on. #1812
* [FEATURE] Add WrapCollectorWith and WrapCollectorWithPrefix #1766
* [FEATURE] Add exemplars for native histograms #1686
* [ENHANCEMENT] exp/api: Bubble up status code from writeResponse #1823
* [ENHANCEMENT] collector/go: Update runtime metrics for Go v1.23 and v1.24 #1833
* [BUGFIX] exp/api: client prompt return on context cancellation #1729

## 1.22.0 / 2025-04-07

:warning: This release contains potential breaking change if you use experimental `zstd` support introduce in #1496 :warning:

Experimental support for `zstd` on scrape was added, controlled by the request `Accept-Encoding` header.
It was enabled by default since version 1.20, but now you need to add a blank import to enable it.
The decision to make it opt-in by default was originally made because the Go standard library was expected to have default zstd support added soon,
https://github.com/golang/go/issues/62513 however, the work took longer than anticipated and it will be postponed to upcoming major Go versions.


e.g.:
> ```go
> import (
>   _ "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp/zstd"
> )
> ```

* [FEATURE] prometheus: Add new CollectorFunc utility #1724
* [CHANGE] Minimum required Go version is now 1.22 (we also test client_golang against latest go version - 1.24) #1738
* [FEATURE] api: `WithLookbackDelta` and `WithStats` options have been added to API client. #1743
* [CHANGE] :warning: promhttp: Isolate zstd support and klauspost/compress library use to promhttp/zstd package. #1765

## 1.21.1 / 2025-03-04

* [BUGFIX] prometheus: Revert of `Inc`, `Add` and `Observe` cumulative metric CAS optimizations (#1661), causing regressions on low contention cases.
* [BUGFIX] prometheus: Fix GOOS=ios build, broken due to process_collector_* wrong build tags.

## 1.21.0 / 2025-02-17

:warning: This release contains potential breaking change if you upgrade `github.com/prometheus/common` to 0.62+ together with client_golang. :warning:

New common version [changes `model.NameValidationScheme` global variable](https://github.com/prometheus/common/pull/724), which relaxes the validation of label names and metric name, allowing all UTF-8 characters. Typically, this should not break any user, unless your test or usage expects strict certain names to panic/fail on client_golang metric registration, gathering or scrape. In case of problems change `model.NameValidationScheme` to old `model.LegacyValidation` value in your project `init` function.

* [BUGFIX] gocollector: Fix help message for runtime/metric metrics. #1583
* [BUGFIX] prometheus: Fix `Desc.String()` method for no labels case. #1687
* [ENHANCEMENT] prometheus: Optimize popular `prometheus.BuildFQName` function; now up to 30% faster. #1665
* [ENHANCEMENT] prometheus: Optimize `Inc`, `Add` and `Observe` cumulative metrics; now up to 50% faster under high concurrent contention. #1661
* [CHANGE] Upgrade prometheus/common to 0.62.0 which changes `model.NameValidationScheme` global variable. #1712
* [CHANGE] Add support for Go 1.23. #1602
* [FEATURE] process_collector: Add support for Darwin systems. #1600 #1616 #1625 #1675 #1715
* [FEATURE] api: Add ability to invoke `CloseIdleConnections` on api.Client using `api.Client.(CloseIdler).CloseIdleConnections()` casting. #1513
* [FEATURE] promhttp: Add `promhttp.HandlerOpts.EnableOpenMetricsTextCreatedSamples` option to create OpenMetrics _created lines. Not recommended unless you want to use opt-in Created Timestamp feature. Community works on OpenMetrics 2.0 format that should make those lines obsolete (they increase cardinality significantly). #1408
* [FEATURE] prometheus: Add `NewConstNativeHistogram` function. #1654

## 1.20.5 / 2024-10-15

* [BUGFIX] testutil: Reverted #1424; functions using compareMetricFamilies are (again) only failing if filtered metricNames are in the expected input.

## 1.20.4 / 2024-09-07

* [BUGFIX] histograms: Fix possible data race when appending exemplars vs metrics gather. #1623

## 1.20.3 / 2024-09-05

* [BUGFIX] histograms: Fix possible data race when appending exemplars. #1608

## 1.20.2 / 2024-08-23

## 1.20.0 / 2024-08-14

* [CHANGE] :warning: go-collector: Remove `go_memstat_lookups_total` metric which was always 0; Go runtime stopped sharing pointer lookup statistics. #1577
* [FEATURE] :warning: go-collector: Add 3 default metrics: `go_gc_gogc_percent`, `go_gc_gomemlimit_bytes` and `go_sched_gomaxprocs_threads` as those are recommended by the Go team. #1559
* [FEATURE] go-collector: Add more information to all metrics' HELP e.g. the exact `runtime/metrics` sourcing each metric (if relevant). #1568 #1578
* [FEATURE] testutil: Add CollectAndFormat method. #1503
* [FEATURE] histograms: Add support for exemplars in native histograms. #1471
* [FEATURE] promhttp: Add experimental support for `zstd` on scrape, controlled by the request `Accept-Encoding` header. #1496
* [FEATURE] api/v1: Add `WithLimit` parameter to all API methods that supports it. #1544
* [FEATURE] prometheus: Add support for created timestamps in constant histograms and constant summaries. #1537
* [FEATURE] process-collector: Add network usage metrics: `process_network_receive_bytes_total` and `process_network_transmit_bytes_total`. #1555

* [CHANGE] Moved packages to the prometheus/common repo: `text`, `model`,
  `extraction`.
* [CHANGE] Deprecated a number of functions.
* [FEATURE] Allow custom registries. Added `Registerer` and `Gatherer`
  interfaces.
* [FEATURE] Separated HTTP exposition, allowing custom HTTP handlers (package
  `promhttp`) and enabling the creation of other exposition mechanisms.
* [FEATURE] `MustRegister` is variadic now, allowing registration of many
  collectors in one call.
* [FEATURE] Added HTTP API v1 package.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Numerous documentation improvements.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved metric sorting.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Inlined fnv64a hashing for improved performance.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Several test improvements.
* [BUGFIX] Handle collisions in MetricVec.

## 0.7.0 / 2015-07-27

* [CHANGE] Rename ExporterLabelPrefix to ExportedLabelPrefix.
* [BUGFIX] Closed gaps in metric consistency check.
* [BUGFIX] Validate LabelName/LabelSet on JSON unmarshaling.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Document the possibility to create "empty" metrics in
  a metric vector.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Fix and clarify various doc comments and the README.md.
* [ENHANCEMENT] (Kind of) solve "The Proxy Problem" of http.InstrumentHandler.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Change responseWriterDelegator.written to int64.

## 0.6.0 / 2015-06-01

* [CHANGE] Rename process_goroutines to go_goroutines.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Validate label names during YAML decoding.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add LabelName regular expression.
* [BUGFIX] Ensure alignment of struct members for 32-bit systems.

## 0.5.0 / 2015-05-06

* [BUGFIX] Removed a weakness in the fingerprinting aka signature code.
  This makes fingerprinting slower and more allocation-heavy, but the
  weakness was too severe to be tolerated.
* [CHANGE] As a result of the above, Metric.Fingerprint is now returning
  a different fingerprint. To keep the same fingerprint, the new method
  Metric.FastFingerprint was introduced, which will be used by the
  Prometheus server for storage purposes (implying that a collision
  detection has to be added, too).
* [ENHANCEMENT] The Metric.Equal and Metric.Before do not depend on
  fingerprinting anymore, removing the possibility of an undetected
  fingerprint collision.
* [FEATURE] The Go collector in the exposition library includes garbage
  collection stats.
* [FEATURE] The exposition library allows to create constant "throw-away"
  summaries and histograms.
* [CHANGE] A number of new reserved labels and prefixes.

## 0.4.0 / 2015-04-08

* [CHANGE] Return NaN when Summaries have no observations yet.
* [BUGFIX] Properly handle Summary decay upon Write().
* [BUGFIX] Fix the documentation link to the consumption library.
* [FEATURE] Allow the metric family injection hook to merge with existing
  metric families.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Removed cgo dependency and conditional compilation of procfs.
* [MAINTENANCE] Adjusted to changes in matttproud/golang_protobuf_extensions.

## 0.3.2 / 2015-03-11

* [BUGFIX] Fixed the receiver type of COWMetric.Set(). This method is
  only used by the Prometheus server internally.
* [CLEANUP] Added licenses of vendored code left out by godep.

## 0.3.1 / 2015-03-04

* [ENHANCEMENT] Switched fingerprinting functions from own free list to
  sync.Pool.
* [CHANGE] Makefile uses Go 1.4.2 now (only relevant for examples and tests).

## 0.3.0 / 2015-03-03

* [CHANGE] Changed the fingerprinting for metrics. THIS WILL INVALIDATE ALL
  PERSISTED FINGERPRINTS. IF YOU COMPILE THE PROMETHEUS SERVER WITH THIS
  VERSION, YOU HAVE TO WIPE THE PREVIOUSLY CREATED STORAGE.
* [CHANGE] LabelValuesToSignature removed. (Nobody had used it, and it was
  arguably broken.)
* [CHANGE] Vendored dependencies. Those are only used by the Makefile. If
  client_golang is used as a library, the vendoring will stay out of your way.
* [BUGFIX] Remove a weakness in the fingerprinting for metrics. (This made
  the fingerprinting change above necessary.)
* [FEATURE] Added new fingerprinting functions SignatureForLabels and
  SignatureWithoutLabels to be used by the Prometheus server. These functions
  require fewer allocations than the ones currently used by the server.

## 0.2.0 / 2015-02-23

* [FEATURE] Introduce new Histagram metric type.
* [CHANGE] Ignore process collector errors for now (better error handling
  pending).
* [CHANGE] Use clear error interface for process pidFn.
* [BUGFIX] Fix Go download links for several archs and OSes.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Massively improve Gauge and Counter performance.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Catch illegal label names for summaries in histograms.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduce allocations during fingerprinting.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Remove cgo dependency. procfs package will only be included if
  both cgo is available and the build is for an OS with procfs.
* [CLEANUP] Clean up code style issues.
* [CLEANUP] Mark slow test as such and exclude them from travis.
* [CLEANUP] Update protobuf library package name.
* [CLEANUP] Updated vendoring of beorn7/perks.

## 0.1.0 / 2015-02-02

* [CLEANUP] Introduced semantic versioning and changelog. From now on,
  changes will be reported in this file.
