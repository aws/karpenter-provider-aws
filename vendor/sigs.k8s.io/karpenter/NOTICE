When donating the karpenter-core project to the CNCF, not all contributors were reached
to sign the CNCF CLA prior to donation. As such, according to the CNCF rules to donate a repository,
we must add a NOTICE referencing section 7 of the CLA with a list of developers who could not be reached.

`7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
submit it to the Foundation separately from any Contribution, identifying the
complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
(including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the
work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".`
