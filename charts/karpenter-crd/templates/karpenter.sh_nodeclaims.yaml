                    TerminationGracePeriod is the maximum duration the controller will wait before forcefully deleting the pods on a node, measured from when deletion is first initiated.

                    Warning: this feature takes precedence over a Pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds value, and bypasses any blocked PDBs or the karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt annotation.

                    This field is intended to be used by cluster administrators to enforce that nodes can be cycled within a given time period.
                    When set, drifted nodes will begin draining even if there are pods blocking eviction. Draining will respect PDBs and the do-not-disrupt annotation until the TGP is reached.

                    Karpenter will preemptively delete pods so their terminationGracePeriodSeconds align with the node's terminationGracePeriod.
                    If a pod would be terminated without being granted its full terminationGracePeriodSeconds prior to the node timeout,
                    that pod will be deleted at T = node timeout - pod terminationGracePeriodSeconds.

                    The feature can also be used to allow maximum time limits for long-running jobs which can delay node termination with preStop hooks.
                    If left undefined, the controller will wait indefinitely for pods to be drained.
