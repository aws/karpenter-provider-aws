                NodePoolSpec is the top level nodepool specification. Nodepools
                launch nodes in response to pods that are unschedulable. A single nodepool
                is capable of managing a diverse set of nodes. Node properties are determined
                from a combination of nodepool and pod scheduling constraints.

                            TerminationGracePeriod is the maximum duration the controller will wait before forcefully deleting the pods on a node, measured from when deletion is first initiated.

                            Warning: this feature takes precedence over a Pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds value, and bypasses any blocked PDBs or the karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt annotation.

                            This field is intended to be used by cluster administrators to enforce that nodes can be cycled within a given time period.
                            When set, drifted nodes will begin draining even if there are pods blocking eviction. Draining will respect PDBs and the do-not-disrupt annotation until the TGP is reached.

                            Karpenter will preemptively delete pods so their terminationGracePeriodSeconds align with the node's terminationGracePeriod.
                            If a pod would be terminated without being granted its full terminationGracePeriodSeconds prior to the node timeout,
                            that pod will be deleted at T = node timeout - pod terminationGracePeriodSeconds.

                            The feature can also be used to allow maximum time limits for long-running jobs which can delay node termination with preStop hooks.
                            If left undefined, the controller will wait indefinitely for pods to be drained.

                    Weight is the priority given to the nodepool during scheduling. A higher
                    numerical weight indicates that this nodepool will be ordered
                    ahead of other nodepools with lower weights. A nodepool with no weight
                    will be treated as if it is a nodepool with a weight of 0.

                          This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.
