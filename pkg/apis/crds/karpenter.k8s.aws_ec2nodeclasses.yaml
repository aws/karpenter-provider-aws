                          Alias specifies which EKS optimized AMI to select.
                          Each alias consists of a family and an AMI version, specified as "family@version".
                          Valid families include: al2, al2023, bottlerocket, windows2019, and windows2022.
                          The version can either be pinned to a specific AMI release, with that AMIs version format (ex: "al2023@v20240625" or "bottlerocket@v1.10.0").
                          The version can also be set to "latest" for any family. Setting the version to latest will result in drift when a new AMI is released. This is **not** recommended for production environments.
                          Note: The Windows families do **not** support version pinning, and only latest may be used.

                              IOPS is the number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3, io1, and io2 volumes,

                              rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                              The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                                 * io2: 100-64,000 IOPS

                              For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for Instances built

                              Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.
