## Designs

The designs in this folder are merged RFCs. They are historical artifacts that demonstrate the designs of features when they were implemented. They are not kept up to date as changes are made. 

## Documentation

These documents are also not the source truth for the karpenter.sh website. The source for that lives [here](https://github.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/tree/main/website/content/en/preview).

## Contributing

If you wish to work on a feature that requires an RFC, use the documents in this folder as a reference for structure or content. There is no template.
